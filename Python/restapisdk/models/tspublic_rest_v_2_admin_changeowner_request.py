            provide single input as ALL.    If multiple object ids along with
            ALL is provided as input, then ALL will be considered.
        from_user (FromUserNameAndIDInput): A JSON object of name or GUIDs of
            the current owner of the objects. When both are given then id is
            considered.   If a list of object ids are provided as input for
            TsObjectId, then only for those ids that have owner as the value
            provided in fromUser, the owner will be changed.   Provide either
            name or id as input. When both are given user id will be
            considered.
        to_user (ToUserNameAndIDInput): A JSON object of name or GUIDs of the
            new owner for the objects. When both are given then id is
            considered.
