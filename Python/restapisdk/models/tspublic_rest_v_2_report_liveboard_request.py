    Attributes:
        id (string): GUID of the Liveboard to download.    This field is
            considered only when no input is provided for transientContent
            field.
        viz_id (list of string): JSON Array of GUIDs of the visualizations in
            the Liveboard to be included in the downloaded file.    For CSV,
            XLSX and PNG file download, visualization id is mandatory. CSV and
            XLSX is valid only for visualization of type table and PNG is
            valid for charts.    Only one value will be accepted for these
            formats. If multiple values are provided then first value in the
            array will be considered.
        transient_content (string): If you have embedded ThoughtSpot in your
            host application, and you want to download Liveboards with unsaved
            changes as a file, pass the transient content from the browser
            fetch request, using the getExportRequestForCurrentPinboard
            method. For more information, see
            https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=liveboard-export-ap
            i#transient-pinboard.
        runtime_filter (string): JSON object which contains filter condition
            to filter the data at the time of data retrieval.    Example:
            {"col1":"region","op1":"EQ","val1":"northeast","col2":"date","op2":
            "BET","val2":["1625126400000","1625126400000"]}    For more
            information, see
            https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=runtime-filters
        runtime_sort (string): JSON object which provides columns to sort the
            data at the time of data retrieval.    Example:
            {"sortCol1":"region","asc1":true,"sortCol2":"date"}    For more
            information, see
            https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=runtime-filters
        mtype (Type16Enum): Type of file to be generated.
