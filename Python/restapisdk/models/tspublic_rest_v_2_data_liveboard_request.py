    """Implementation of the 'Tspublic Rest V2 Data Liveboard Request' model.

    TODO: type model description here.

    Attributes:
        offset (int): The offset point, starting from where the records should
            be included in the response.    If no input is provided then
            offset starts from 0.
        batch_number (int): An alternate way to set offset for the starting
            point of the response.    The value in offset field will not be
            considered if batchNumber field has value greater than 0.   
            Offset value will be calculated as (batchNumber - 1) * batchSize. 
            It is mandatory to provide a value for batchSize with batchNumber.
            Example:    Assume response has 100 records. Now,  batchNumber is
            set as 2 and batchSize as 10, then offset value will be 10. So, 10
            records starting from 11th record will be considered.
        batch_size (int): The number of records that should be included in the
            response starting from offset position.    If no input is
            provided, then all records starting from the value provided in
            offset is included in the response.
        id (string): The GUID of the Liveboard
        viz_id (list of string): A JSON array of GUIDs of the visualizations
            in the Liveboard.
        runtime_filter (string): JSON object which contains filter condition
            to filter the data at the time of data retrieval.    Example:
            {"col1":"region","op1":"EQ","val1":"northeast","col2":"date","op2":
            "BET","val2":["1625126400000","1625126400000"]}    For more
            information, see
            https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=runtime-filters
        runtime_sort (string): JSON object which provides columns to sort the
            data at the time of data retrieval.    Example:
            {"sortCol1":"region","asc1":true,"sortCol2":"date"}    For more
            information, see
            https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=runtime-filters
        format_type (FormatType1Enum): The format of the data in the response.
            FULL: The response comes in "column":"value" format.    COMPACT:
            The response includes only the value of the columns.
