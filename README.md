# ThoughtSpot REST API SDK
Repository for automatically generated REST API SDK projects. TypeScript and Java SDKs are currently available, with more SDKs planned in the near future.<br>
The source code for the SDKs is located in the `sdks` directory

For Python, please see the library at https://github.com/thoughtspot/thoughtspot_rest_api_v1_python, which has implementations of V1 and V2.0 REST API and can be installed via pip from PyPi.

`api-spec` directory does has the current openapi specs for V2.0 REST API.
