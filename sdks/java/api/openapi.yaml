        Version: 10.4.0.cl or later


        Creates a Conversation object to start an AI-driven conversation based on a specific data model.

        Requires at least view access to the metadata object specified in the request.

        #### Usage guidelines

        This API requires the `metadata_identifier` parameter to define the context for the conversation.

        You can also specify the tokens to initiate the conversation as shown in this example:

        `"tokens": "[tea],[sales],[type]"`

        If the API request is successful, ThoughtSpot returns the ID of the conversation.

        > ###### Note:
        > * This endpoint is currently in Beta. Breaking changes may be introduced before the endpoint is made Generally Available.
        > * This endpoint requires Spotter - please contact ThoughtSpot support to enable Spotter on your cluster.

        Version: 10.4.0.cl or later


        Allows sending a follow-up message to an ongoing conversation within the context of the metadata model.

        Requires at least view access to the metadata object specified in the request.

        #### Usage guidelines

        The API requires you to specify the `conversation_identifier` in the request path, and a `metadata_identifier` and `message` string in the request body.

        If the API request is successful, ThoughtSpot returns the session ID, tokens used in the conversation, and visualization type.

        Retrieves details of the current session token for the bearer token provided in the request header.

        This API endpoint does not create a new token. Instead, it returns details about the token, including the token string, creation time, expiration time, and the associated user.

        Use this endpoint to introspect your current session token, debug authentication issues, or when a frontend application needs session token details.

        Any ThoughtSpot user with a valid bearer token can access this endpoint and send an API request

      description: "\n Version: 10.4.0.cl or later\n\n\nGets an authentication token\
        \ with custom rules and security attributes and creates a full session in\
        \ ThoughtSpot for a given user. By default, the token obtained from ThoughtSpot\
        \ remains valid for 5 mins.\n\nTo add a new user and assign privileges during\
        \ auto creation, you need `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**)\
        \ privilege. If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac)\
        \ is enabled, the `CONTROL_TRUSTED_AUTH`(**Can Enable or Disable Trusted Authentication**)\
        \ privilege and edit access to the data source is required.\n\nTo assign security\
        \ attributes with filter rules and Parameters to the JWT token, you'll need\
        \ administrator privileges and edit access to the data source (Worksheet or\
        \ Model). If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac)\
        \ is enabled, the `CONTROL_TRUSTED_AUTH`(**Can Enable or Disable Trusted Authentication**)\
        \ privilege and edit access to the data source is required.\n\n#### Usage\
        \ guidelines\n\nYou can generate the token for a user by providing a `username`\
        \ and `password`, or by using the cluster’s `secret_key`.\n\nTo generate a\
        \ `secret_key` on your cluster, the administrator must enable [Trusted authentication](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=trusted-auth#trusted-auth-enable)\
        \ in the **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Security Settings** page.\n\n\
        **Note**: When both `password` and `secret_key` are included in the API request,\

        \ enabled on your instance, the API login request with basic authentication\
        \ (`username`  and `password` ) returns an error. You can switch to token-based\
        \ authentication with  `secret_key`  or contact ThoughtSpot Support for assistance.\n\
        \n##### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with tokens\n\nTo implement\
        \ Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and assign security entitlements to\
        \ users during session creation, you can generate a token with custom filtering\
        \ rules and Parameters in the `filter_rules` and `parameter_values` array\
        \ respectively. These attributes can be configured to persist on a specific\
        \ set of objects for user sessions initiated using the token. Once defined,\
        \ the rules are added to the user's `access_control_properties` object, after\
        \ which all sessions will use the persisted values.\n\nSpecify the object\
        \ type as `LOGICAL_TABLE`. \n\nFor more information, see [ABAC via tokens\
        \ Documentation](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/api-authv2#_get_tokens_with_custom_rules_and_filter_conditions).\n\
        \n##### Just-in-time provisioning\n\nFor just-in-time user creation and provisioning,\
        \ define the following attributes:\n\n* `auto_create`\n* `username`\n* `display_name`\n\
        * `email`\n* `groups`\n\nSet `auto_create` to `true` if the user is not available\
        \ in ThoughtSpot. If the user already exists in ThoughtSpot and the `auto_create`\
        \ parameter is set to `true` in the API request, the user properties such\
        \ as the display name, email, Org and group assignment will not be updated\
        \ with new values. If `auto_create` is set to `true`, it won't create formula\
        \ variables and hence won't be applicable for `variable_values`.\n\nFor more\
        \ information, see [Just-in-time provisioning](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/just-in-time-provisioning).\n\
        \n##### Important point to note\nAll options in the token creation APIs that\
        \ define access to the content in ThoughtSpot will do so during the token\
        \ creation and not when the token is being used for authentication. For example,\
        \ `auto_create:true` will create the user when the authentication token is\
        \ created. Persist options such as  `APPEND`, `REPLACE`, `RESET` will persist\
        \ security parameters on the user profile when the token is created, while\
        \ Persist option `NONE` will not persist anything but will be honoured in\
        \ the session.\n\n##### Formula Variables\nBefore using variables_values,\
        \ variables must be created using Create Variable API with type as Formula_Variable\
        \ (/api/rest/2.0/template/variables/create)\nThe persist_option RESET and\
        \ NONE cannot be used when variable_values are provided in the request.\n\
        If you are working with variable_values, you must use other (APPEND, REPLACE)\
        \ supported modes.\nIf you want to use RESET or NONE, do not pass any variable_values.\
        \ In such cases, variable_values will remain unaffected.\nWhen using object_id\
        \ with variable_values, models are supported. \n\n\n\n\n"

        Gets an authentication token and creates a full session in ThoughtSpot for a given user. By default, the token obtained from ThoughtSpot remains valid for 5 mins.

        You can generate the token for a user by providing a `username` and `password`, or by using the cluster’s `secret_key` (for [Trusted authentication](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=trusted-auth#trusted-auth-enable)).

        To generate a `secret_key` on your cluster, the administrator must enable **Trusted authentication** in the **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Security Settings** page. For more information, see [Trusted authentication](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=trusted-auth#trusted-auth-enable).

        **Note**: When both `password` and `secret_key` are included in the API request, `password` takes precedence.

        If Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on your instance, the API login request with basic authentication (`username`  and `password` ) returns an error. You can switch to token-based authentication with  `secret_key`  or contact ThoughtSpot Support for assistance.

        #### Just-in-time provisioning

        For just-in-time user creation and provisioning, define the following attributes:

        * `auto_create`
        * `username`
        * `display_name`
        * `email`
        * `group_identifiers`

        Set `auto_create` to `True` if the user is not available in ThoughtSpot. If the user already exists in ThoughtSpot and the `auto_create` parameter is set to `true`, the API call will update user properties like display name, email and group assignment.

        For more information, see [Just-in-time provisioning](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/just-in-time-provisioning).

        To add a new user and assign privileges, you need `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**) privilege. If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled, the `CONTROL_TRUSTED_AUTH`(**Can Enable or Disable Trusted Authentication**) privilege is required.

        #### Important point to note
        All options in the token creation APIs changing the content in ThoughtSpot will do so during the token creation and not when the token is being used for authentication. For example, `auto_create:true` will create the user when the authentication token is created.

        Gets an authentication token that provides access to a specific metadata object. By default, the token obtained from ThoughtSpot remains valid for 5 mins.

        You can generate the token for a user by providing a `username` and `password`, or by using the cluster’s `secret key` (for [Trusted authentication](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=trusted-auth#trusted-auth-enable)).

        To generate a `secret_key` on your cluster, the administrator must enable **Trusted authentication** in the **Develop** > **Customizations** > **Security Settings** page.

        **Note**: When both `password` and `secret_key` are included in the API request,  `password` takes precedence.

        If Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on your instance, the API login request with basic authentication (`username`  and `password` ) returns an error. You can switch to token-based authentication with  `secret_key`  or contact ThoughtSpot Support for assistance.

        #### Just-in-time provisioning

        For just-in-time user creation and provisioning, define the following attributes:

        * `auto_create`
        * `username`
        * `display_name`
        * `email`
        * `group_identifiers`

        Set `auto_create` to `True` if the user is not available in ThoughtSpot. If the user already exists in ThoughtSpot and the `auto_create` parameter is set to `true`, the API call will update user properties like display name, email and group assignment.

        For more information, see [Just-in-time provisioning](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/just-in-time-provisioning).

        To add a new user and assign privileges, you need `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**) privilege. If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled, the `CONTROL_TRUSTED_AUTH`(**Can Enable or Disable Trusted Authentication**) privilege is required.

        Creates a login session for a ThoughtSpot user with Basic authentication.

        In Basic authentication method, REST clients log in to ThoughtSpot using `username` and `password` attributes. On a multi-tenant cluster with Orgs, users can pass the ID of the Org in the API request to log in to a specific Org context.

        **Note**: If Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on your instance, the API login request with basic authentication (`username`  and `password` ) returns an error. Contact ThoughtSpot Support for assistance.

        A successful login returns a session cookie that can be used in your subsequent API requests.

        Revokes the authentication token issued for current user session.

        The token of your current session expires when you make a call to the `/api/rest/2.0/auth/token/revoke` endpoint.
        the users will not be able to access ThoughtSpot objects until a new token is obtained.

        To restart your session, request for a new token from ThoughtSpot. See [Get Full Access Token](#/http/api-endpoints/authentication/get-full-access-token).

        Gets connection configuration objects.

        Requires `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) and edit permissions to the connection object, or `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**) privilege.

        If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled on your instance, the `CAN_CREATE_OR_EDIT_CONNECTIONS` (**Can create/edit Connections**) privilege is required.

        #### Usage guidelines
        * To get a list of all configurations available in the ThoughtSpot system, send the API request with only the connection name or GUID in the request body.
        * To fetch details of a configuration object, specify the configuration object name or GUID.

         Version: 10.12.0.cl or later


        Updates a connection configuration object.

        Requires `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) and edit permissions to the connection object, or `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**) privilege.

        If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled on your instance, the `CAN_CREATE_OR_EDIT_CONNECTIONS` (**Can create/edit Connections**) privilege is required.

        #### Supported operations
        This API endpoint lets you perform the following operations in a single API request:

         * Edit the name or description of the configuration
         * Edit the configuration properties
         * Edit the `policy_type`
         * Edit the type of authentication
         * Enable or disable a configuration

        #### Parameterized Connection Support
        For parameterized oauth based connections, only the `same_as_parent` and `policy_process_options` attributes are allowed. These attributes are not applicable to connections that are not parameterized.

         **NOTE**: When updating a configuration where `disabled` is `true`, you must reset `disabled` to `true` in your update request payload. If not explicitly set again, the API will default `disabled` to `false`.

        Validates the difference in connection metadata between CDW and ThoughtSpot.

        Requires `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) privilege.
        If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled on your instance, the following Data control privileges may be required:

        - `CAN_MANAGE_CUSTOM_CALENDAR`(**Can manage custom calendars**)
        - `CAN_CREATE_OR_EDIT_CONNECTIONS` (**Can create/edit Connections**)
        - `CAN_MANAGE_WORKSHEET_VIEWS_TABLES` (**Can manage data models**)

        Returns a boolean indicating whether there is any difference between the connection metadata at ThoughtSpot and CDW.

        To get the connection metadata difference status, pass the connection GUID as `connection_identifier` in the API request.

        Gets connection objects.
        Requires `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) or `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**) privilege.
        If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled on your instance, the `CAN_CREATE_OR_EDIT_CONNECTIONS` (**Can create/edit Connections**) privilege is required.

        - To get a list of all connections available in the ThoughtSpot system, send the API request without any attributes in the request body.
        - To get the connection objects for a specific type of data warehouse, specify the type in `data_warehouse_types`.
        - To fetch details of a connection object, specify the connection object GUID or name. The `name_pattern` attribute allows passing partial text with `%` for a wildcard match.
        - To get details of the database, schemas, tables, or columns from a data connection object, specify `data_warehouse_object_type`.
        - To get a specific database, schema, table, or column from a connection object, define the object type in `data_warehouse_object_type` and object properties in the `data_warehouse_objects` array. For example, to search for a column, you must pass the database, schema, and table names in the API request.
          Note that in the following example, object properties are set in a hierarchical order (`database` > `schema` > `table` > `column`).

        ```
        {
          "connections": [
            {
              "identifier": "b9d1f2ef-fa65-4a4b-994e-30fa2d57b0c2",
              "data_warehouse_objects": [
                {
                  "database": "NEBULADEV",
                  "schema": "INFORMATION_SCHEMA",
                  "table": "APPLICABLE_ROLES",
                  "column": "ROLE_NAME"
                }
              ]
            }
          ],
          "data_warehouse_object_type": "COLUMN"
        }
        ```

        - To fetch data by `configuration`, specify `data_warehouse_object_type`. For example, to fetch columns from the `DEVELOPMENT` database, specify the `data_warehouse_object_type` as `DATABASE` and define the `configuration` string as `{"database":"DEVELOPMENT"}`. To get column data for a specific table, specify the table, for example,`{"database":"RETAILAPPAREL","table":"PIPES"}`.
        - To query connections by `authentication_type`, specify `data_warehouse_object_type`. Supported values for `authentication_type` are:
          - `SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: For connections that require service account credentials to authenticate to the Cloud Data Warehouse and fetch data.
          - `OAUTH`: For connections that require OAuth credentials to authenticate to the Cloud Data Warehouse and fetch data. Teradata, Oracle, and Presto Cloud Data Warehouses do not support the OAuth authentication type.
          - `IAM`: For connections that have the IAM OAuth set up. This authentication type is supported on Amazon Redshift connections only.
          - `EXTOAUTH`: For connections that have External OAuth set up. ThoughtSpot supports external [OAuth with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD)](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/ connections-snowflake-azure-ad-oauth) and [Okta for Snowflake data connections](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connections-snowflake-okta-oauth).
          - `KEY_PAIR`: For connections that require Key Pair account credentials to authenticate to the Cloud Data Warehouse and fetch data. This authentication type is supported on Snowflake connections only.
          - `OAUTH_WITH_PKCE`: For connections that require OAuth with PKCE account credentials to authenticate to the Cloud Data Warehouse and fetch data. This authentication type is supported on Snowflake, Starburst, Databricks, Denodo  connections only.
          - `EXTOAUTH_WITH_PKCE`: For connections that require External OAuth With PKCE account credentials to authenticate to the Cloud Data Warehouse and fetch data. This authentication type is supported on Snowflake connections only.
          - `OAUTH_WITH_PEZ`: For connections that require OAuth With PEZ account credentials to authenticate to the Cloud Data Warehouse and fetch data. This authentication type is supported on Amazon Redshift connections only.
          - `OAUTH_WITH_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL`: For connections that require OAuth With Service Principal account credentials to authenticate to the Cloud Data Warehouse and fetch data. This authentication type is supported on Databricks connections only.
          - `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: For connections that require Personal Access Token account credentials to authenticate to the Cloud Data Warehouse and fetch data. This authentication type is supported on Databricks connections only.
          - `OAUTH_CLIENT_CREDENTIALS`: For connections that require OAuth Client Credentials to authenticate to the Cloud Data Warehouse and fetch data. This authentication type is supported on Snowflake connections only.
        - To include more details about connection objects in the API response, set `include_details` to `true`.
        - You can also sort the output by field names and filter connections by tags.

        **NOTE**: When filtering connection records by parameters other than `data_warehouse_types` or `tag_identifiers`, ensure that you set `record_size` to `-1` and `record_offset` to `0` for precise results.

    post:
      description: "\n Version: 10.12.0.cl or later\n\n\nCreates a new [custom calendar](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connections-cust-cal).\n\
        \nRequires `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) or `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can\
        \ administer ThoughtSpot**) privilege.\nIf [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac)\
        \ is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance, the `CAN_MANAGE_CUSTOM_CALENDAR`\
        \ (**Can manage custom calendars**) privilege is required.\n\n\n#### Usage\
        \ guidelines\n\nYou can create a custom calendar from scratch or an existing\
        \ Table in ThoughtSpot. For both methods of calendar creation, the following\
        \ parameters are required:\n\n* Name of the custom calendar.\n* Calendar creation\
        \ method. To create a calendar from an existing table, specify the method:\n\
        \n - `FROM_EXISTING_TABLE` - Creates calendar from the table reference provided\
        \ in the API request.\n - `FROM_INPUT_PARAMS` - Creates a calendar from the\
        \ parameters defined in the API request.\n\n* Connection ID and Table name\n\
        * Database and schema name attributes:\n  For most Cloud Data Warehouse (CDW)\
        \ connectors, both `database_name` and `schema_name` attributes are required.\
        \  \n  However, the attribute requirements are conditional and vary based\
        \ on the connector type and its metadata structure. For example, for connectors\
        \ such as Teradata, MySQL, SingleSore, Amazon Aurora MySQL, Amazon RDS MySQL,\
        \ Oracle, and GCP_MYSQL, the `schema_name` is required, whereas the `database_name`\
        \ attribute is not.\n  Similarly, connectors such as ClickHouse require you\
        \ to specify the `database_name` and the schema specification in such cases\
        \ is optional.\n\n**NOTE**: If you are creating a calendar from an existing\
        \ table, ensure that the referenced table matches the required DDL for custom\
        \ calendars. If the schema does not match, the API returns an error.\n\n#####\
        \ Calendar type\nThe API allows you to create the following types of calendars:\n\
        \n* `MONTH_OFFSET`. The default calendar type. A `MONTH_OFFSET` calendar is\
        \ offset by a few months from the standard calendar months (January to December)\
        \ and the year begins with the month defined in the request. For example,\
        \ if the `month_offset` value is set as `April`, the calendar year begins\
        \ in April.\n\n* `4-4-5`. Each quarter in the calendar will include two 4-week\
        \ months followed by one 5-week month.\n* `4-5-4`. Each quarter in the calendar\
        \ will include two 4-week months with a 5-week month between.\n* `5-4-4`.\
        \ Each quarter begins with a 5-week month, followed by two 4-week months.\n\
        \nTo start and end the calendar on a specific date, specify the dates in the\
        \ `MM/DD/YYYY` format. For `MONTH_OFFSET` calendars, ensure that the `start_date`\
        \ matches the month specified in the `month_offset` attribute.\n\nYou can\
        \ also set the starting day of the week and customize the prefixes for year\
        \ and quarter labels.\n\n#### Examples\n\nTo create a calendar from an existing\
        \ table:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"MyCustomCalendar1\",\n  \"table_reference\"\

         Version: 10.12.0.cl or later


        Gets a list of [custom calendars](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connections-cust-cal).

        Requires `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) or `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**) privilege.
        If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance, the `CAN_MANAGE_CUSTOM_CALENDAR` (**Can manage custom calendars**) privilege is required.

        #### Usage guidelines

        By default, the API returns a list of custom calendars for all connection objects. To retrieve custom calendar details for a particular connection, specify the connection ID. You can also use other search parameters such as `name_pattern` and `sort_options` as search filters.

        The `name_pattern` parameter filters and returns only those objects that match the specified pattern. Use `%` as a wildcard for pattern matching.

        \ a [custom calendar](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/connections-cust-cal).\n\
        \nRequires `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) or `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can\

        \ is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance, the `CAN_MANAGE_CUSTOM_CALENDAR`\
        \ (**Can manage custom calendars**) privilege is required.\n\n#### Usage guidelines\n\
        \nYou can update the properties of a calendar using one of the following methods:\n\
        * `FROM_INPUT_PARAMS` to update the calendar properties with the values defined\
        \ in the API request.\n* `FROM_EXISTING_TABLE` Creates a calendar from the\
        \ parameters defined in the API request.\n\nTo update a custom calendar, specify\
        \ the calendar ID as a path parameter in the request URL and the following\
        \ parameters in the request body:  \n\n* Connection ID and Table name\n* Database\
        \ and schema name attributes:\n  For most Cloud Data Warehouse (CDW) connectors,\
        \ both `database_name` and `schema_name` attributes are required.  \n  However,\
        \ the attribute requirements are conditional and vary based on the connector\
        \ type and its metadata structure. For example, for connectors such as Teradata,\
        \ MySQL, SingleSore, Amazon Aurora MySQL, Amazon RDS MySQL, Oracle, and GCP_MYSQL,\
        \ the `schema_name` is required, whereas the `database_name` attribute is\
        \ not.\n  Similarly, connectors such as ClickHouse require you to specify\
        \ the `database_name` and the schema specification in such cases is optional.\n\
        \nThe API allows you to modify the calendar type, month offset value, start\
        \ and end date, starting day of the week, and prefixes assigned to the year\
        \ and quarter labels.   \n\n#### Examples\n\nUpdate a custom calendar using\
        \ an existing Table in ThoughtSpot:\n\n```\n{\n  \"update_method\": \"FROM_EXISTING_TABLE\"\
        ,\n  \"table_reference\": {\n    \"connection_identifier\": \"Connection1\"\
        ,\n    \"database_name\": \"db1\",\n    \"table_name\": \"custom_calendar_2025\"\
        ,\n    \"schame_name\": \"schemaVar\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUpdate a custom calendar\
        \ with the attributes defined in the API request:\n\n```\n{\n  \"update_method\"\
        : \"FROM_INPUT_PARAMS\",\n  \"table_reference\": {\n    \"connection_identifier\"\
        : \"Connection1\",\n    \"database_name\": \"db1\",\n    \"table_name\": \"\

        : \"August\",\n  \"start_day_of_week\": \"Monday\",\n  \"start_date\": \"\

        Gets a list of user group objects from the ThoughtSpot system.

        To get details of a specific user group, specify the user group GUID or name. You can also filter the API response based on User ID, Org ID, Role ID, type of group, sharing visibility, privileges assigned to the group, and the Liveboard IDs assigned to the users in the group.

        Available to all users. Users with `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**) privileges can view all users properties.

        If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled on your instance, the `GROUP_ADMINISTRATION` (**Can manage groups**) privilege is required.

        **NOTE**: If you do not get precise results, try setting `record_size` to `-1` and `record_offset` to `0`.

      description: "\nConvert worksheets to models \n  Version: 10.6.0.cl or later\n\
        \n\n## Prerequisites\n- **Privileges Required:**\n  - `DATAMANAGEMENT` (Can\
        \ manage data) or `ADMINISTRATION` (Can administer ThoughtSpot).\n- **Additional\
        \ Privileges (if RBAC is enabled):**\n  - `CAN_MANAGE_WORKSHEET_VIEWS_TABLES`\
        \ (Can manage data models).\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n### Parameters\n\
        \n1. **worksheet_ids**  \n   - **Description:** A comma-separated list of\
        \ GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) specifying the Worksheets to be converted.\
        \  \n   - **Usage:**  \n     - Used only when `convert_all` is set to `false`.\
        \  \n     - Leave empty or omit when `convert_all` is set to `true`.\n\n2.\
        \ **exclude_worksheet_ids**  \n   - **Description:** A comma-separated list\
        \ of GUIDs specifying Worksheets to be excluded from conversion.  \n   - **Usage:**\
        \  \n     - Useful when `convert_all` is set to `true` and specific Worksheets\
        \ should not be converted.\n\n3. **convert_all**  \n   - **Description:**\
        \ Sets the scope of conversion.\n   - **Options:**  \n     - `true`: Converts\
        \ all Worksheets in the system, except those specified in `exclude_worksheet_ids`.\
        \  \n     - `false`: Converts only the Worksheets listed in `worksheet_ids`.\n\
        \n4. **apply_changes**  \n   - **Description:** Specifies whether to apply\
        \ changes directly to ThoughtSpot or to generate a preview before applying\
        \ any changes.Used for validation of conversion.\n   - **Options:**  \n  \
        \   - `true`: Applies conversion changes directly to ThoughtSpot.\n     -\
        \ `false`: Generates only a preview of the changes and does not apply any\
        \ changes to ThoughtSpot\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Backup Before\
        \ Conversion:**  \n   Always export metadata as a backup before initiating\
        \ the conversion process\n\n2. **Partial Conversion for Testing:**  \n   Test\
        \ the conversion process by setting `convert_all` to `false` and specifying\
        \ a small number of `worksheet_ids`.\n\n3. **Verify Dependencies:**  \n  \
        \ Check for dependent objects, such as Tables and Connections, to avoid invalid\
        \ references.\n\n4. **Review Changes:**  \n   Use `apply_changes: false` to\
        \ preview the impact of the conversion before applying changes.\n\n---\n\n\
        ## Examples\n\n### Convert Specific Worksheets\n```json\n{\n  \"worksheet_ids\"\
        : [\"guid1\", \"guid2\", \"guid3\"],\n  \"exclude_worksheet_ids\": [],\n \
        \ \"convert_all\": false,\n  \"apply_changes\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Convert\

         Version: 9.0.0.cl or later


        Exports the [TML](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/tml) representation of metadata objects in JSON or YAML format.

        Requires `DATADOWNLOADING` (**Can download Data**) and at least view access to the metadata object.

        #### Usage guidelines

        * You can export one or several objects by passing metadata object GUIDs in the `metadata` array.
        * When exporting TML content for a Liveboard or Answer object, you can set `export_associated` to `true` to retrieve TML content for underlying Worksheets, Tables, or Views, including the GUID of each object within the headers. When   `export_associated` is set to `true`, consider retrieving one metadata object at a time.
        * Set `export_fqns` to `true` to add FQNs of the referenced objects in the TML content. For example, if you send an API request to retrieve TML for a Liveboard and its associated objects, the API returns the TML content with FQNs of the referenced Worksheet. Exporting TML with FQNs is useful if ThoughtSpot has multiple objects with the same name and you want to eliminate ambiguity when importing TML files into ThoughtSpot. It eliminates the need for adding FQNs of the referenced objects manually during the import operation.
        * To export only the TML of feedbacks associated with an object, set the GUID of the object as `identifier`, and set the `type` as `FEEDBACK` in the `metadata` array.
        * To export the TML of an object along with the feedbacks associated with it, set the GUID of the object as `identifier`, set the `type` as `LOGIAL_TABLE` in the `metadata` array, and set `export_with_associated_feedbacks` in `export_options` to true.

        For more information, see [TML Documentation](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/tml#_export_a_tml).

        For more information on feedbacks, see [Feedback Documentation](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/sage-feedback).

         Version: 10.1.0.cl or later


        Exports the [TML](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/tml) representation of metadata objects in JSON or YAML format.

        ### **Permissions Required**

        Requires `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) and `USERMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage users**) privileges.

        #### **Usage Guidelines**

        This API is only applicable for `USER`, `GROUP`, and `ROLES` metadata types.

        - `batch_offset` Indicates the starting position within the complete dataset from which the API should begin returning objects. Useful for paginating results efficiently.
        - `batch_size` Specifies the number of objects or items to retrieve in a single request. Helps control response size for better performance.
        - `edoc_format` Defines the format of the TML content. The exported metadata can be in JSON or YAML format.
        - `export_dependent` Specifies whether to include dependent metadata objects in the export. Ensures related objects are also retrieved if needed.
        - `all_orgs_override` Indicates whether the export operation applies across all organizations. Useful for multi-tenant environments where cross-org exports are required.

         Version: 9.0.0.cl or later


        Imports [TML](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/tml) files into ThoughtSpot.

        Requires `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) or `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtsSpot**) privilege.

        If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled on your instance, the following Data control privileges may be required:
        - `CAN_CREATE_OR_EDIT_CONNECTIONS` (**Can create/edit Connections**)
        - `CAN_MANAGE_WORKSHEET_VIEWS_TABLES` (**Can manage data models**)

        #### Usage guidelines

        *  Import all related objects in a single TML Import API call. For example, Tables that use the same Connection object and Worksheets connected to these Tables.
        * Include the `fqn` property to distinguish objects that have the same name.
          For example, if you have multiple Connections or Worksheets with the same name on ThoughtSpot and the Connection or Worksheet referenced in your TML file does not have a unique name to distinguish, it may result in invalid object references.
          Adding `fqn` helps ThoughtSpot differentiate a Table from another with the same name.
          We recommend [exporting TML with FQNs](#/http/api-endpoints/metadata/export-metadata-tml) and using these during the import operation.
        * You can upload multiple TML files at a time.
          If you import a Worksheet along with Liveboards, Answers, and other dependent objects in a single API call, the imported objects will be immediately available for use.
          When you import only a Worksheet object, it may take some time for the Worksheet to become available in the ThoughtSpot system. Please wait for a few minutes, and then proceed to create an Answer and Liveboard from the newly imported Worksheet.

        For more information, see [TML Documentation](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/tml#_import_a_tml).

         Version: 10.4.0.cl or later


        Schedules a task to import [TML](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/tml) files into ThoughtSpot. You can use this API endpoint to process TML objects asynchronously when importing TMLs of large and complex metadata objects into ThoughtSpot. Unlike the synchronous import TML operation, the API processes TML data in the background and returns a task ID, which can be used to check the status of the import task via `/api/rest/2.0/metadata/tml/async/status` API endpoint.

        Requires `DATAMANAGEMENT` (**Can manage data**) or `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtsSpot**) privilege, and edit access to the TML objects.

        If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled on your instance, the following Data control privileges may be required:
        - `CAN_CREATE_OR_EDIT_CONNECTIONS` (**Can create/edit Connections**)
        - `CAN_MANAGE_WORKSHEET_VIEWS_TABLES` (**Can manage data models**)

        #### Usage guidelines

        Gets a list of metadata objects available on the ThoughtSpot system.

        This API endpoint is available to all users who have view access to the object. Users with `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**) privileges can view data for all metadata objects, including users and groups.

        #### Usage guidelines

        - To get all metadata objects, send the API request without any attributes.
        - To get metadata objects of a specific type, set the `type` attribute. For example, to fetch a Worksheet, set the type as `LOGICAL_TABLE`.
        - To filter metadata objects within type `LOGICAL_TABLE`, set the `subtypes` attribute. For example, to fetch a Worksheet, set the type as `LOGICAL_TABLE` & subtypes as `[WORKSHEET]`.
        - To get a specific metadata object, specify the GUID.
        - To customize your search and filter the API response, you can use several parameters.
          You can search for objects created or modified by specific users, by tags applied to the objects, or by using the include parameters like `include_auto_created_objects`, `include_dependent_objects`, `include_headers`, `include_incomplete_objects`, and so on.
          You can also define sorting options to sort the data retrieved in the API response.
        - To get discoverable objects when linientmodel is enabled you can use `include_discoverable_objects` as true else false. Default value is true.
        - For liveboard metadata type, to get the newer format, set the `liveboard_response_format` as V2. Default value is V1.
        - To retrieve only objects that are published, set the `include_only_published_objects` as true. Default value is false.

        **NOTE**: The following parameters support pagination of metadata records:

        - `tag_identifiers`
        - `type`
        - `subtypes`
        - `created_by_user_identifiers`
        - `modified_by_user_identifiers`
        - `owned_by_user_identifiers`
        - `exclude_objects`
        - `include_auto_created_objects`
        - `favorite_object_options`
        - `include_only_published_objects`
        If you are using other parameters to search metadata, set `record_size` to `-1` and `record_offset` to `0`.

        \ To create a schedule on behalf of another user, you need  `ADMINISTRATION`\
        \ (**Can administer Org**) or `JOBSCHEDULING` (**Can schedule for others**)\
        \ privilege and edit access to the Liveboard.\nIf [Role-Based Access Control\

        \  The description text appears as **Description: <your content>** in the\
        \ Liveboard schedule email notifications.\n* For Liveboards with both charts\
        \ and tables, schedule creation is only supported in PDF and XLS formats.\
        \ Schedules created in CSV formats for such Liveboards will fail to run. If\
        \ `PDF` is set as the `file_format`, enable `pdf_options` to get the correct\
        \ attachment. Not doing so may cause the attachment to be rendered empty.\n\
        * To include only specific visualizations, specify the visualization GUIDs\
        \ in the `visualization_identifiers` array.\n* You can schedule a Liveboard\
        \ job to run periodically by setting frequency parameters. You can set the\
        \ schedule to run daily, weekly, monthly or every n minutes or hours. The\
        \ scheduled job can also be configured to run at a specific time of the day\
        \ or on specific days of the week or month. Please ensure that when setting\
        \ the schedule frequency for _minute of the object_, only values that are\
        \ multiples of 5 are included.\n* If the `frequency` parameters are defined,\
        \ you can set the time zone to a value that matches your server's time zone.\
        \ For example, `US/Central`, `Etc/UTC`, `CET`. The default time zone is `America/Los_Angeles`.\n\
        \nFor more information about Liveboard jobs, see [ThoughtSpot Product Documentation](https://docs.thoughtspot.com/cloud/latest/liveboard-schedule).\n\

         Version: 9.0.0.cl or later


        Allows sharing one or several metadata objects with users and groups in ThoughtSpot.

        Requires edit access to the metadata object.

        The API endpoint allows sharing only the following types of metadata objects:
        * Liveboards
        * Visualizations
        * Answers
        * Worksheets
        * Views
        * Connections

        You can provide `READ_ONLY` or `MODIFY` access when sharing an object with another user or group. With `READ_ONLY` access grants view access to the shared object, whereas `MODIFY` provides edit access.

        To prevent a user or group from accessing the shared object, specify the GUID or name of the principal and set `shareMode` to `NO_ACCESS`.

        Allows unpublishing metadata objects from organizations in ThoughtSpot.

        Requires ADMINISTRATION role and TENANT scope.

        The API endpoint allows unpublishing the following types of metadata objects:
        * Liveboards
        * Answers
        * Logical Tables

        When unpublishing objects, you can:
        * Include dependencies by setting `include_dependencies` to true - this will unpublish all dependent objects if no other published object is using them
        * Force unpublish by setting `force` to true - this will break all dependent objects in the unpublished organizations

        Imports user data from external databases into ThoughtSpot. During the user import operation:

        * If the specified users are not available in ThoughtSpot, the users are created and assigned a default password. Defining a `default_password` in the API request is optional.
        * If `delete_unspecified_users` is set to `true`, the users not specified in the API request, excluding the `tsadmin`, `guest`, `system` and `su` users, are deleted.
        * If the specified user objects are already available in ThoughtSpot, the object properties are updated and synchronized as per the input data in the API request.

        A successful API call returns the object that represents the changes made in the ThoughtSpot system.

        Requires `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**) privilege.
        If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled on your instance, the `USER_ADMINISTRATION` (**Can manage users**) privilege is required.

        Allows you to connect a ThoughtSpot instance to a Git repository.

        Requires `ADMINISTRATION` (**Can administer ThoughtSpot**) privilege.

        If [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/rbac) is enabled on your instance on your instance, the `CAN_SETUP_VERSION_CONTROL` (**Can set up version control**) privilege.

        You can use this API endpoint to connect your ThoughtSpot development and production environments to the development and production branches of a Git repository.

        Before using this endpoint to connect your ThoughtSpot instance to a Git repository, check the following prerequisites:

        * You have a Git repository. If you are using GitHub, make sure you have a valid account and an access token to connect ThoughtSpot to GitHub. For information about generating a token, see [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

        * Your access token has `repo` scope that grants full access to public and private repositories.
        * Your Git repository has a branch that can be configured as a default branch in ThoughtSpot.

        For more information, see [Git integration documentation](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/?pageid=git-integration).

        **Note**: ThoughtSpot supports only GitHub / itHub Enterprise for CI/CD.

        Allows you to deploy a commit and publish TML content to your ThoughtSpot instance.

        Requires at least edit access to the objects used in the deploy operation.

        The API deploys the head of the branch unless a `commit_id` is specified in the API request. If the branch name is not defined in the request, the default branch is considered for deploying commits.

        For more information, see [Git integration documentation](https://developers.thoughtspot.com/docs/git-integration).

        Reverts TML objects to a previous commit specified in the API request.

        Requires at least edit access to objects.

        In the API request, specify the `commit_id`. If the branch name is not specified in the request, the API will consider the default branch configured on your instance.

        By default, the API reverts all objects. If the revert operation fails for one of the objects provided in the commit, the API returns an error and does not revert any object.
